# sonar
A companion daemon for Situations app on Sailfish

+ Implements autostart for Situations background service
+ Implements Sonar daemon running as root and providing an open interface for Situations (or any other app) to access a set of privileged features

NOTE: This repository is now archived. A fundamentally different approach to functionality requiring root privileges has been implemented with situations-daemon project instead.
